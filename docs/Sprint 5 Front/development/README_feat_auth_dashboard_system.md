# Branch feat/auth-dashboard-system - Authentication & Dashboard Implementation

## Overview

Implements the complete authentication system and dashboard interface for TechSubs. The branch provides JWT token management, protected routes, and a functional dashboard that matches the provided wireframes with subscription management capabilities.

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication System (AuthContext)

Complete authentication flow using React Context API:

Context Structure:
- Global state management for user, token, and loading states
- Automatic token validation on app initialization
- API integration with axios interceptors for token handling

Functions:
- `login(email, password, remember)` - Authenticates user and stores JWT token with error handling
- `register(name, email, password, passwordConfirmation)` - Creates new user account with validation
- `logout()` - Clears token and user data from localStorage and state, calls logout API endpoint
- `useAuth()` - Custom hook for accessing authentication context

Token Management:
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage with 'auth_token' key
- Automatic API header injection via axios interceptors
- Token validation on app startup with /profile endpoint
- Graceful fallback to login page on token expiration

Form Integration:
- Traditional React state management with useState for form handling
- Email format validation and required field checks
- Password confirmation matching for registration
- Remember me functionality for persistent sessions

### Protected Routes System

Route protection implementation:

ProtectedRoute Component:
- Checks authentication status before rendering protected content
- Automatic redirection to login page for unauthenticated users
- Loading state handling during token validation
- Seamless integration with React Router v6

Route Structure:
- Public routes: Landing page, Login, Register
- Protected routes: Dashboard, My Services, My Subscriptions, Create Service, Create Subscription
- Automatic navigation based on authentication state

### Dashboard Implementation

Layout Structure:
- Sidebar navigation with TechSubs branding
- Main content area with responsive grid layout
- Mobile-responsive design with collapsible sidebar
- Consistent spacing and typography with landing page

Data Integration:
- API calls to /subscriptions endpoint for subscription data
- API calls to /profile endpoint for user information
- Mock data fallback for development without backend
- Realistic pricing data (Netflix €15.99, Spotify €9.99, etc.)

### API Service Layer

Centralized API communication:

Axios Configuration:
- Base URL configuration via environment variables
- Request interceptors for automatic token injection
- Response interceptors for error handling
- Timeout configuration for better user experience

Error Handling:
- Network error detection and user feedback
- Token expiration handling with automatic logout
- Validation error display in forms
- Graceful degradation when backend unavailable

### Styling Consistency

Tailwind CSS Integration:
- Consistent color scheme with landing page (purple/indigo gradients)
- Responsive design patterns matching existing components
- Card-based layout with subtle shadows and borders
- Glassmorphism effects for modern appearance

Component Styling:**
- Sidebar with backdrop blur
- Cards with white background with subtle shadows
- Tables: Striped rows with hover effects
- Buttons: Gradient backgrounds matching brand colors

### Form Handling Strategy

Traditional React State Management:
- useState hooks for form state management
- Controlled components with onChange handlers
- Manual validation with error state management
- Direct API integration with loading states

Validation Rules:
- Email format validation with regex patterns
- Password strength requirements
- Required field validation with custom messages
- Password confirmation matching

### Testing Strategy

Component Testing:
- React Testing Library for component rendering and interaction
- Mock API responses with manual mocking
- User event simulation for form interactions
- Authentication flow testing with mocked contexts

API Testing:
- Basic API endpoint testing
- Authentication token handling verification
- Error response handling validation
- Mock data integration for consistent testing

## Security Considerations

Token Security:
- Automatic token cleanup on logout
- Token validation on every protected route access
- No sensitive data stored in client-side state

API Security:
- CORS handling for cross-origin requests
- Request timeout to prevent hanging requests
- Error message sanitization to avoid information leakage
- Input validation on all form fields
