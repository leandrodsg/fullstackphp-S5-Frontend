# Branch feat/service-crud-system - Service Management Implementation

## Overview

Implements the complete service management system for TechSubs, providing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for technology services. The branch extends the existing authentication and dashboard system with service management capabilities following REST API principles and modern React patterns.

## Technical Implementation

- Error boundary implementation for graceful error handling
- Success redirection with React Router v6 programmatic navigation using useNavigate hook

EditService Component:
- Dynamic service loading with useParams hook for URL parameter extraction

### Form Validation System

Field Validation Rules:
- Name: Required field with trim() preprocessing, 2-100 character range validation using custom regex
- Category: Enum-based validation against predefined service categories with type safety
- Description: Required field with HTML sanitization, 10-500 character validation with word count
- Website URL: RFC 3986 compliant URL validation with protocol enforcement and domain verification

Error Handling Strategy:
- Real-time validation using debounced input handlers to prevent excessive validation calls
- Server-side error integration with form state using error boundary pattern
- Field-specific error messages with internationalization support preparation
- Form submission prevention using disabled state management and validation gate pattern
- Custom validation hooks for reusable validation logic across components

### API Integration Layer

Endpoint Integration:
- GET /services - Paginated service retrieval with query parameter serialization
- GET /services/{id} - Individual service fetching with caching strategy implementation
- POST /services - Service creation with optimistic updates and rollback mechanism
- PUT /services/{id} - Service updates using PATCH semantics for partial updates
- DELETE /services/{id} - Soft delete implementation with confirmation workflow

Request/Response Handling:
- Automatic JWT token injection using axios interceptors with token refresh logic
- Loading state management using custom useAsync hook with abort controller support
- Error response parsing with HTTP status code mapping to user-friendly messages
- Success confirmation with toast notifications and navigation state management
- Request retry mechanism with exponential backoff for transient failures

Data Transformation:
- Form data serialization using custom serializer with nested object support
- Response data normalization using adapter pattern for consistent data structure
- Date formatting with timezone handling using date-fns library
- URL validation and sanitization with XSS prevention measures
- Data caching implementation using React Query for optimized API calls

### State Management Architecture

Component-level State Management:
- Form data management using useReducer for complex form state with action-based updates
- Loading states implemented with custom useAsync hook providing loading, error, and data states
- Error state handling using error boundary pattern with fallback UI components
- Success state management with navigation using React Router v6 useNavigate hook
- State persistence using sessionStorage for form draft functionality

Data Flow Architecture:
- Unidirectional data flow following Flux architecture principles
- Context API implementation for shared state with provider pattern optimization
- State lifting strategies for parent-child component communication
- Immutable state updates using immer library for complex nested state objects
- Custom hooks for state logic encapsulation and reusability across components

### React Router v6 Integration

Navigation Patterns:
- Programmatic navigation using useNavigate hook replacing deprecated useHistory
- Route parameter extraction with useParams hook for dynamic route handling
- Location state management using useLocation for passing data between routes
- Search parameter handling with useSearchParams for query string management
- Route protection implementation using outlet context for nested protected routes

Route Configuration:
- Nested routing structure with outlet-based layout components
- Lazy loading implementation using React.lazy and Suspense for code splitting
- Route-based error boundaries for granular error handling
- Dynamic route generation for service detail pages with parameter validation
- Breadcrumb navigation with automatic route hierarchy detection

### Testing Implementation

Unit Testing:
- Component rendering validation using React Testing Library with custom render utilities
- Form submission behavior testing with user event simulation
- API integration mocking using MSW (Mock Service Worker) for realistic API responses
- Error handling scenario coverage with error boundary testing
- Custom hook testing using renderHook utility for isolated hook logic testing

Integration Testing:
- Complete user workflow testing with end-to-end scenario coverage
- Navigation flow validation using React Router testing utilities
