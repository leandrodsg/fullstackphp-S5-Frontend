# README - Branch feat/reports-system

## Overview

This branch implements the reports system for TechSubs, providing subscription analytics, data visualization, and export functionality.

## Branch Information

- Testing Framework: React Testing Library 16.3.0
- React Version: 19.1.1

## Implementations

### Reports Management Pages

#### Reports Component

- Header section with "Reports" title and "Analyze your subscription data and export reports" subtitle
- Filter section with date range (Next Billing From/To), service and status filtering capabilities
- Data visualization table with columns: Service, Plan, Price, Status, Next Billing, Days Until, Billing Cycle
- Service avatars using first letter of service name in purple circular badges
- Status badges with color coding (Active: green, Cancelled: red)
- Export functionality with CSV and Excel download capability
- Pagination controls with results count display
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach and table optimization

### Filtering System Implementation

#### Service Filtering

- Dynamic service loading from subscriptions API
- Single service selection with dropdown interface
- Service name display in filter options
- Real-time filter application with "Apply Filters" button
- Filter state persistence during session
- Clear filters functionality with reset capability

#### Status Filtering

- Status-based data segmentation (Active, Cancelled, All)
- Visual status indicators with color coding
- Combined filtering with service and date range filters
- Filter state management with manual application
- Real-time data updates based on filter changes

### Data Analytics Implementation

#### Summary Calculations

- Filtered subscription count calculation
- Results display with pagination information
- Active services count with status validation
- Filtered data summary updates
- Date range filtering for next billing dates
- Real-time filter application with manual trigger

#### Data Visualization

- Tabular data display with sorting capabilities
- Service avatar integration using first letter badges
- Status badge system with consistent color coding (green/red)
- Price formatting with currency symbols
- Date formatting for billing cycles and next billing dates
- Days until next billing with relative time display
- Responsive table design with mobile optimization

### Export Functionality

#### CSV Export System

- Complete subscription data export to CSV and Excel formats
- Filtered data export maintaining current filter state
- Frontend filtering implementation for date range, service, and status
- Date formatting for export compatibility
- Currency formatting preservation in export
- File naming with timestamp for organization

### API Integration

#### Reports API Implementation
Centralized API integration for reports:
- GET /api/v1/subscriptions for subscription data retrieval (via subscriptionAPI.getAll())
- Frontend data aggregation and filtering implementation
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading state management with progress indicators
- Response data transformation and normalization
- Export functionality through exportReports API function

### Technical Architecture

#### State Management

- Filter state management using useState (dateFrom, dateTo, service, status)
- Loading states for data operations
- Error state handling with recovery options
- Data state management with subscription information
- Unique services extraction for filter dropdown
- Export state management for download operations

### Testing Implementation

#### Test Suite Coverage
Comprehensive testing approach:
- Component rendering tests for reports page
- Filter functionality testing with mock data
- Summary calculation testing with various scenarios
- Error handling testing with API failure simulation
- Loading state testing with async operations
- Basic integration testing for core functionality

#### Testing Adaptations
Simplified testing approach due to implementation complexity:
- Focus on essential functionality rather than comprehensive integration
- Mock data structure adjustments for component compatibility
- Router import corrections for dependency consistency
- Reduced test complexity to maintain stability
- Essential test coverage for critical user paths

#### Mock Data Management
Realistic test data for reports:
- Subscription data with service associations
- Various status scenarios for filtering tests
- Edge cases for summary calculations
- Error scenarios for error handling validation
- Performance testing data for large datasets
