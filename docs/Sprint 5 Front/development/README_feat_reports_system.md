# README - Branch feat/reports-system

## Overview

This branch implements the reports system for TechSubs, providing subscription analytics, data visualization, and export functionality.

## Branch Information

- Testing Framework: React Testing Library 16.3.0
- React Version: 19.1.1

## Implementations

### Reports Management Pages

#### Reports Component

- Header section with "Reports" title and "Analyze your subscription data and export reports" subtitle
- Filter section with service and status filtering capabilities
- Data visualization table with columns: Service, Plan, Price, Status, Next Billing, Actions
- Service avatars for popular services (Netflix, Spotify, Adobe, GitHub, Dropbox)
- Status badges with color coding (Active, Expiring, Cancelled)
- Summary footer displaying: Total Subscriptions, Monthly Cost, Active Services
- Export functionality with CSV download capability
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach and table optimization

### Filtering System Implementation

#### Service Filtering

- Dynamic service loading from subscriptions API
- Multi-service selection with checkbox interface
- Service avatar display in filter options
- Real-time filter application with immediate results
- Filter state persistence during session
- Clear filters functionality with reset capability

#### Status Filtering

- Status-based data segmentation (Active, Expiring, Cancelled, All)
- Visual status indicators with color coding
- Combined filtering with service filters
- Filter state management with URL parameter support
- Real-time data updates based on filter changes

### Data Analytics Implementation

#### Summary Calculations

- Total subscription count calculation
- Monthly cost aggregation with currency formatting
- Active services count with status validation
- Filtered data summary updates
- Currency conversion and formatting
- Percentage calculations for status distribution

#### Data Visualization

- Tabular data display with sorting capabilities
- Service avatar integration for visual identification
- Status badge system with consistent color coding
- Price formatting with currency symbols
- Date formatting for billing cycles
- Responsive table design with mobile optimization

### Export Functionality

#### CSV Export System

- Complete subscription data export to CSV format
- Filtered data export maintaining current filter state
- Custom column selection for export
- Date formatting for export compatibility
- Currency formatting preservation in export
- File naming with timestamp for organization

### API Integration

#### Reports API Implementation
Centralized API integration for reports:
- GET /api/v1/subscriptions for subscription data retrieval
- Data aggregation and filtering on frontend
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading state management with progress indicators
- Response data transformation and normalization
- Caching strategies for improved performance

### Technical Architecture

#### State Management

- Filter state management using useState
- Loading states for data operations
- Error state handling with recovery options
- Data state management with subscription information
- Summary state calculations with real-time updates
- Export state management for download operations

### Testing Implementation

#### Test Suite Coverage
Comprehensive testing approach:
- Component rendering tests for reports page
- Filter functionality testing with mock data
- Summary calculation testing with various scenarios
- Error handling testing with API failure simulation
- Loading state testing with async operations
- Basic integration testing for core functionality

#### Testing Adaptations
Simplified testing approach due to implementation complexity:
- Focus on essential functionality rather than comprehensive integration
- Mock data structure adjustments for component compatibility
- Router import corrections for dependency consistency
- Reduced test complexity to maintain stability
- Essential test coverage for critical user paths

#### Mock Data Management
Realistic test data for reports:
- Subscription data with service associations
- Various status scenarios for filtering tests
- Edge cases for summary calculations
- Error scenarios for error handling validation
- Performance testing data for large datasets
