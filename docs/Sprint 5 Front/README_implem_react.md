# TechSubs Frontend - React Client Implementation

## Overview

This document records the implementation of the TechSubs frontend React application. It covers the technical decisions, configurations, and features developed throughout Sprint 5 Frontend, including the landing page implementation and component architecture.

## Project Context

The TechSubs frontend client was developed to consume the REST API created in Sprint 5 backend. The API provides complete functionality for managing technology subscriptions with JWT authentication, role-based access control, and comprehensive CRUD operations.

Backend API features available:
- Laravel Passport authentication with JWT tokens
- Role-based system (Admin/User)
- Complete endpoints for Auth, Services, Subscriptions, and Reports
- Data export functionality in CSV format
- Comprehensive API documentation

Frontend requirements:
- React application with modern development practices
- JWT token-based authentication integration
- Complete interface implementation following provided wireframes
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Integration with all backend API endpoints
- Export functionality for reports and data analysis

## Technology Stack

Technologies used in the React frontend:

- React 18 with functional components and hooks
- Create React App for project setup
- Tailwind CSS via CDN for styling
- Axios for API communication
- React Router v6 for navigation
- React Hook Form for form handling
- React Testing Library with Jest for testing
- Environment variables for configuration

## Implementation

## Branch setup/react-project-base

The setup/react-project-base branch established the foundational configuration for the React application. The focus was on creating a solid base structure that would support all subsequent feature development while maintaining simplicity and educational clarity.

Essential dependencies were installed including react-router-dom for navigation, axios for API communication, and react-hook-form for form management.

Tailwind CSS was configured via CDN to avoid build configuration complexity while providing access to the utility-first styling approach specified in the project requirements.

API integration was prepared through axios configuration with automatic token handling and error management. Environment variables were configured to support different deployment environments. Testing was implemented to validate all configuration aspects.

## Branch feat/auth-landing-pages

Implements the TechSubs landing page as a single-screen layout without vertical scroll. The page replicates the design from the Blade template with React components.

Components implemented:
- Navigation: Sticky header with glassmorphism effect and authentication buttons
- HeroSection: Two-column layout with title and dashboard mockup
- FeaturesSection: Three feature cards with gradient backgrounds
- Footer: Simple footer with backdrop blur

Key features:
- Compact spacing system (py-4) to eliminate scroll
- Embedded SVG icons for performance
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Dashboard mockup showing realistic service pricing
- Gradient styling matching the original design

## Branch feat/auth-dashboard-system

Implements the complete authentication system and dashboard interface following the provided wireframes. The branch integrates JWT token management, protected routes, and a functional dashboard with subscription management.

Authentication system implemented:
- AuthContext with React Context API for global state management
- JWT token persistence in localStorage with automatic validation
- Login/Register forms with React Hook Form validation
- Protected routes with automatic redirection
- Token refresh and logout functionality

Dashboard features implemented:
- Summary cards showing monthly totals and subscription counts
- Recent subscriptions table with service details and actions
- Responsive layout matching wireframe specifications
- Integration with /subscriptions and /profile API endpoints
- Mock data fallback for development without backend

The implementation uses React Context API to manage authentication state globally, avoiding prop drilling between components. Tailwind CSS maintains visual consistency with the previously developed landing page. React Router v6 handles navigation between public and protected pages. Tests cover critical scenarios like login, dashboard, and route protection. The API layer uses axios with interceptors to automatically inject JWT tokens in requests.
