# TechSubs Frontend - React Client Implementation

## Overview

This document records the implementation of the TechSubs frontend React application. It covers the technical decisions, configurations, and features developed throughout Sprint 5 Frontend, including the landing page implementation and component architecture.

## Project Context

The TechSubs frontend client was developed to consume the REST API created in Sprint 5 backend. The API provides complete functionality for managing technology subscriptions with JWT authentication, role-based access control, and comprehensive CRUD operations.

Backend API features available:
- Laravel Passport authentication with JWT tokens
- Role-based system (Admin/User)
- Complete endpoints for Auth, Services, Subscriptions, and Reports
- Data export functionality in CSV format
- Comprehensive API documentation

Frontend requirements:
- React application with modern development practices
- JWT token-based authentication integration
- Complete interface implementation following provided wireframes
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Integration with all backend API endpoints
- Export functionality for reports and data analysis

## Technology Stack

Technologies used in the React frontend:

- React 19.1.1 with functional components and hooks
- Create React App for project setup
- Tailwind CSS 4.1.13 for styling
- Axios 1.12.2 for API communication
- React Router 7.9.3 for navigation
- React Hook Form 7.63.0 for form handling
- React Testing Library 16.3.0 with Jest for testing
- Environment variables for configuration

## Implementation

## Branch setup/react-project-base

The setup/react-project-base branch established the foundational configuration for the React application. The focus was on creating a solid base structure that would support all subsequent feature development while maintaining simplicity and educational clarity.

Essential dependencies were installed including react-router-dom for navigation, axios for API communication, and react-hook-form for form management.

Tailwind CSS was configured via CDN to avoid build configuration complexity while providing access to the utility-first styling approach specified in the project requirements.

API integration was prepared through axios configuration with automatic token handling and error management. Environment variables were configured to support different deployment environments. Testing was implemented to validate all configuration aspects.

## Branch feat/auth-landing-pages

Implements the TechSubs landing page as a single-screen layout without vertical scroll. The page replicates the design from the Blade template with React components.

Components implemented:
- Navigation: Sticky header with glassmorphism effect and authentication buttons
- HeroSection: Two-column layout with title and dashboard mockup
- FeaturesSection: Three feature cards with gradient backgrounds
- Footer: Simple footer with backdrop blur

Key features:
- Compact spacing system (py-4) to eliminate scroll
- Embedded SVG icons for performance
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Dashboard mockup showing realistic service pricing
- Gradient styling matching the original design

## Branch feat/auth-dashboard-system

Implements the complete authentication system and dashboard interface following the provided wireframes. The branch integrates JWT token management, protected routes, and a functional dashboard with subscription management.

Authentication system implemented:
- AuthContext with React Context API for global state management
- JWT token persistence in localStorage with automatic validation
- Login/Register forms with React Hook Form validation
- Protected routes with automatic redirection
- Token refresh and logout functionality

Dashboard features implemented:
- Summary cards showing monthly totals and subscription counts
- Recent subscriptions table with service details and actions
- Responsive layout matching wireframe specifications
- Integration with /subscriptions and /profile API endpoints
- Mock data fallback for development without backend

The implementation uses React Context API to manage authentication state globally, avoiding prop drilling between components. Tailwind CSS maintains visual consistency with the previously developed landing page. React Router 7.9.3 handles navigation between public and protected pages. Tests cover critical scenarios like login, dashboard, and route protection using React Testing Library with manual API mocking. The API layer uses axios with interceptors to automatically inject JWT tokens in requests.

## Branch feat/service-crud-system

Implements the complete service management system with full CRUD operations for technology services. The branch extends the existing authentication and dashboard infrastructure with service management capabilities following modern React patterns and REST API principles.

Service management features implemented:
- CreateService: Form-based service creation with validation
- EditService: Dynamic service editing with pre-populated data
- MyServices: Paginated service listing with search and management actions
- ServiceDetails: Service information display with actions

Technical implementations:
- Form validation system with real-time feedback and server integration
- API integration layer with full CRUD endpoint support
- Component-level state management following React best practices
- Comprehensive testing coverage including unit and integration tests
- Performance optimizations with React.memo, useCallback, and useMemo
- Security considerations with input validation and authentication integration

## Branch feat/subscription-crud-system

Implements the complete subscription management system with full CRUD operations for technology subscriptions. The branch extends the existing service management infrastructure with subscription lifecycle management capabilities following the same architectural patterns and design principles.

Subscription management features implemented:
- CreateSubscription: Form-based subscription creation with service selection and validation
- EditSubscription: Dynamic subscription editing with pre-populated data and service integration
- MySubscriptions: Paginated subscription listing with status management and filtering
- SubscriptionDetails: Subscription information display with lifecycle actions

Technical implementations:
- Centralized subscriptionAPI with full CRUD endpoint support and consistent error handling
- Form validation system with real-time feedback and server-side integration
- Service integration for subscription creation with dynamic service selection
- Status management system with visual indicators and lifecycle controls
- Date handling for billing cycles and subscription periods
- Currency and pricing display with internationalization support

## Branch feat/subscriptions-crud

Implements the complete subscription management system with full CRUD operations for technology subscriptions.

Subscription management features implemented:
- MySubscriptions: Complete subscription listing page with service avatars, status badges, and summary footer
- CreateSubscription: Modal-based subscription creation with service selection and billing configuration
- EditSubscription: Dynamic subscription editing with pre-populated data and service integration
- SubscriptionDetails: Subscription information display with lifecycle management actions

CRUD operations implemented:
- GET /api/v1/subscriptions for subscription listing with filtering and pagination
- POST /api/v1/subscriptions for subscription creation with service association
- PUT /api/v1/subscriptions/{id} for subscription updates and modifications
- DELETE /api/v1/subscriptions/{id} for subscription removal with confirmation
- PATCH /api/v1/subscriptions/{id}/cancel for subscription cancellation
- PATCH /api/v1/subscriptions/{id}/reactivate for subscription reactivation

Technical implementations:
- Service integration with dynamic service selection and avatar display
- Status management system with visual indicators (Active, Expiring, Cancelled)
