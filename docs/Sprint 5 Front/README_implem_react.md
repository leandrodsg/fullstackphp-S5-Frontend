# TechSubs Frontend - React Client Implementation

## Overview

This document provides a detailed record of the implementation process for the TechSubs frontend client, describing the technical decisions, configurations, and features developed in each branch throughout Sprint 5 Frontend. It serves as a technical continuation of the main README, focusing on the evolution of the React application, architectural decisions, and the rationale behind each major development step.

## Project Context

The TechSubs frontend client was developed to consume the REST API created in Sprint 5 backend. The API provides complete functionality for managing technology subscriptions with JWT authentication, role-based access control, and comprehensive CRUD operations.

Backend API features available:
- Laravel Passport authentication with JWT tokens
- Role-based system (Admin/User)
- Complete endpoints for Auth, Services, Subscriptions, and Reports
- Data export functionality in CSV format
- Comprehensive API documentation

Frontend requirements:
- React application with modern development practices
- JWT token-based authentication integration
- Complete interface implementation following provided wireframes
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Integration with all backend API endpoints
- Export functionality for reports and data analysis

## Technology Stack Decisions

The frontend implementation follows modern React development practices while maintaining simplicity appropriate for a bootcamp-level project:

- React 18 with functional components and hooks
- Create React App for project bootstrapping (despite deprecation, chosen for educational consistency)
- Tailwind CSS via CDN for rapid styling without build complexity
- Axios for HTTP client with interceptors for token management
- React Router v6 for client-side routing
- React Hook Form for form handling and validation
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Environment-based configuration for API integration

## Implementation

## Branch setup/react-project-base

The setup/react-project-base branch established the foundational configuration for the React application. The focus was on creating a solid base structure that would support all subsequent feature development while maintaining simplicity and educational clarity.

Essential dependencies were installed including react-router-dom for navigation, axios for API communication, and react-hook-form for form management.

Tailwind CSS was configured via CDN to avoid build configuration complexity while providing access to the utility-first styling approach specified in the project requirements.

API integration was prepared through axios configuration with automatic token handling and error management. Environment variables were configured to support different deployment environments. Testing was implemented to validate all configuration aspects.
