# TechSubs Frontend - React Client Implementation

## Overview

This document records the implementation of the TechSubs frontend React application. It covers the technical decisions, configurations, and features developed throughout Sprint 5 Frontend, including the landing page implementation and component architecture.

## Project Context

The TechSubs frontend client was developed to consume the REST API created in Sprint 5 backend. The API provides complete functionality for managing technology subscriptions with JWT authentication, role-based access control, and comprehensive CRUD operations.

Backend API features available:
- Laravel Passport authentication with JWT tokens
- Role-based system (Admin/User)
- Complete endpoints for Auth, Services, Subscriptions, and Reports
- Data export functionality in CSV format
- Comprehensive API documentation

Frontend requirements:
- React application with modern development practices
- JWT token-based authentication integration
- Complete interface implementation following provided wireframes
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Integration with all backend API endpoints
- Export functionality for reports and data analysis

## Technology Stack

Technologies used in the React frontend:

- React 19.1.1 with functional components and hooks
- Create React App for project setup
- Tailwind CSS 4.1.13 for styling
- Axios 1.12.2 for API communication
- React Router 7.9.3 for navigation
- React Hook Form 7.63.0 for form handling
- React Testing Library 16.3.0 with Jest for testing
- Environment variables for configuration

## Implementation

## Branch setup/react-project-base

The setup/react-project-base branch established the foundational configuration for the React application. The focus was on creating a robust base structure that would support all subsequent feature development.

Dependencies were installed including react-router for navigation, axios for API communication, and react-hook-form for form management.

Tailwind CSS was configured via CDN in the public/index.html file, providing access to the utility-first styling approach specified in the project requirements with custom color palette configuration.

API integration was prepared through axios configuration with automatic token handling and error management. Environment variables were configured to support different deployment environments. Testing was implemented to validate all configuration aspects.

## Branch feat/auth-landing-pages

Implements the TechSubs landing page as a single-screen layout without vertical scroll. The page replicates the design from the Blade template with React components.

Components implemented:
- Navigation: Sticky header with glassmorphism effect and authentication buttons
- HeroSection: Two-column layout with title and dashboard mockup
- FeaturesSection: Three feature cards with gradient backgrounds
- Footer: Footer with backdrop blur

More details: [README_feat_auth_landing_pages.md](development/README_feat_auth_landing_pages.md)

## Branch feat/auth-dashboard-system

Implements the complete authentication system and dashboard interface following the provided wireframes. The branch integrates JWT token management, protected routes, and a functional dashboard with subscription management.

Authentication system implemented:
- AuthContext with React Context API for global state management
- JWT token persistence in localStorage with automatic validation
- Login/Register forms with React Hook Form validation
- Protected routes with automatic redirection
- Token refresh and logout functionality

Dashboard features implemented:
- Summary cards showing monthly totals and subscription counts
- Recent subscriptions table with service details and actions
- Responsive layout matching wireframe specifications
- Integration with /subscriptions and /profile API endpoints
- Mock data fallback for development without backend

The implementation uses React Context API to manage authentication state globally, avoiding prop drilling between components. Tailwind CSS maintains visual consistency with the previously developed landing page. React Router v7.9.3 handles navigation between public and protected pages. Tests cover critical scenarios like login, dashboard, and route protection using React Testing Library with API mocking. The API layer uses axios with interceptors to automatically inject JWT tokens in requests.

- PUT /api/v1/subscriptions/{id} for subscription updates and modifications
- DELETE /api/v1/subscriptions/{id} for subscription removal with confirmation
- PATCH /api/v1/subscriptions/{id}/cancel for subscription cancellation
- PATCH /api/v1/subscriptions/{id}/reactivate for subscription reactivation

Technical implementations:
- Service integration with dynamic service selection and avatar display
